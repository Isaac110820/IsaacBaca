            <p>This project demonstrates a variety of data exploration techniques using three different data sets:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The “comics” data set which contains information on all comic characters that have been introduced by DC and Marvel is used to explore categorical data.</li>
                <li>The “cars” data set which contains information on all new models of cars for sale in the US in a certain year is used to explore numerical data.</li>
                <li>The “gapminder” data set which contains information on demographic data in various countries throughout the world is used to explore numerical summaries.</li>
            </ul>
           
            <h1>A visualization of one users experience with dating apps in 2022</h1>

            </ul>

            <p>This is a data manipulation/data visualization project which utilizes the dplyr and ggplot2 packages in R to create a visualization of one users experience with three different dating apps in the year 2022.
                Visualizations include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A count of who messaged first, grouped by app</li>
                <li>A count of phone numbers exchanged between the user and the match, grouped by app</li>
                <li>A count of the amount of first dates, grouped by app</li>
                <li>Box plots demonstrating the cost of first dates, grouped by app</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Filtering, Summarizing, Sorting, and Grouping Mutiple Data Sets Using the "sqldf" Package</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://isaac110820.github.io/SQLqueries-In-Rmd/Rmarkdown.html">See the full project in Rmd here (code and output)</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p>The “sqldf” package in R allows the user to query data using SQL code. This project utilizes three data sets to demonstrate a series of intermediate  SQL queries.  The data sets include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A “films” data set which includes the titles of films, the year they were released, the country, the duration in minutes, the language of the film, the certification, gross revenue, and the budget of the film.</li>
                <li>A “People” data set which includes the name, birthdate, and death date of famous people</li>
                <li>A “Reviews” data set which includes a film ID, user number, critic number, imdb score, number of votes, and number of facebook likes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The queries include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Selecting and counting data</li>
                <li>Filtering data by various features</li>
                <li>The use of aggregate functions to summarize data</li>
                <li>Sorting and grouping data by various features</li>
            </ul>
