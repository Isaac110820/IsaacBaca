            <h1>Client Feedback Pipeline</h1> 

            <div class="line-break"></div>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The client is implementing a new software system and needs to migrate millions of records, many of which require extensive cleaning before migration. 
                Iâ€™ve developed a pipeline that automates the feedback process, generating an organized Excel workbook that highlights the records needing attention. 
                This allows the client to easily identify and address any issues before the migration.</p>
