            <p>This is a SQL data cleaning project using a data set containing information about the Nashville housing market. Data cleaning involved: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Standardizing the date format (leaving the day/month/year and removing the time).</li>
                <li>Populating missing values for the Property Address data.</li>
                <li>Separating the property address and owner address columns into separate fields for Street, City, and State.</li>
                <li>Changing the “Y” and “N” to “Yes” and “No” in the “Sold as Vacant” field.</li>
                <li>Deleting redundant columns.</li>
            </ul>


            <h1>Filtering, Summarizing, Sorting, and Grouping Mutiple Data Sets</h1>

                <li><a href="https://github.com/Isaac110820/IntermediateSQLqueries/blob/main/IntermediateSQLqueries.sql">See the full project here</a></li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>This project utilizes three data sets to demonstrate a series of basic SQL queries.  The data sets include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A “films” data set which includes the titles of films, the year they were released, the country, the duration in minutes, the language of the film, the certification, gross revenue, and the budget of the film.</li>
                <li>A “People” data set which includes the name, birthdate, and death date of famous people.</li>
                <li>A “Reviews” data set which includes a film ID, user number, critic number, imdb score, number of votes, and number of facebook likes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The queries include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Selecting and counting data.</li>
                <li>Filtering data by various features.</li>
                <li>The use of aggregate functions to summarize data.</li>
                <li>Sorting and grouping data by various features.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Covid-19 Global Infection and Death Rate</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Isaac110820/CovidDataExploration/blob/main/SQLQuery1.sql">See the full project here</a></li>
            
            </ul>
            <p>This project contains data on covid deaths and covid vaccinations from February 2020 – April 2021.  The goal of this project is to utilize various SQL queries to answer important questions concerning the infection and death rate in various countries around the world.  These questions include: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>What percentage of the population in any given country became infected with covid?</li>
                <li>What percentage of infections ended in death?</li>
                <li>Which countries have the highest infection/death rate as a proportion of their population?</li>
            </ul>
