                        <p>Jan 2022 - Dec 2022</p>
                        <p>As a graduate statistical consultant for Peabody College, I utilized my knowledge of statistical modeling and scientific 
                            research design to support the research efforts of faculty members in the Peabody College at Vanderbilt. 
                            This work involved providing advice on statistics/methodology related questions on a range of projects including:</p>
                        
                        <ol type="I">
                            <li>Modeling the episodic and longitudinal growth of depression over time.</li>

                            <p>The goal of the proposed project was to reconcile epidemiological (between-person) and
                                episodic (within-person) approaches to modeling depression.  The suggested modeling approach included using Hidden Markov 
                                Modeling to model the within-person episodicity of depressive episodes, and a growth curve model, fit within a Bayesian 
                                framework to model the between-person longitudinal growth of depression over time.  The intent was to use a Bayesian fit statistic 
                                to compare the two models and assess the relative model fit.
                                </p>

                            <li>Developing a data analysis plan for education policy research concerning students who are at high risk for emotional/behavioral disorders.</li>

                            <p>The focus of this study was to determine if the ratio of relationship building to negative/restrictive practices in a classroom setting is 
                                predictive of relationship quality and engagement for students at high risk for emotional/behavioral disorders. The data analysis plan 
                                included advice on scientific methodology issues including: controlling for family-wise error rate/multiple regressions, handling nested 
                                data, and handling missing data.
