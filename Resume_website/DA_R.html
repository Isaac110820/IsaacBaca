            <p>This project utilizes two data sets:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The first data set contains a summary of teacher effectiveness ratings broken out by school. 
                    Teachers are assigned a rating of Highly Effective, Effective, Minimally Effective, or Ineffective 
                    based on the districtâ€™s teacher evaluation rubric. </li>
                <li>The second data set contains aggregated student test results for the 2013-2014 state assessment for all schools in a district, with results broken out by grade and subgroup.</li>
            </ol>


            <p>This project has two parts:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In part one of this project, I summarize the Student Scores data to show the percent of 
                    students who are proficient or higher in math at each school. I then populate a table showing 
                    the top ten schools in math proficiency along with their proficiency rates (percent of 
                    students scoring at proficient or higher).</li>
                <li>In part two of this project, I explore the relationship between math proficiency and educator effectiveness at the school level.</li>
            </ol>
