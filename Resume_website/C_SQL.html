            <p>This project utilizes three data sets to demonstrate a series of basic SQL queries.  The data sets include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A “films” data set which includes the titles of films, the year they were released, the country, the duration in minutes, the language of the film, the certification, gross revenue, and the budget of the film.</li>
                <li>A “People” data set which includes the name, birthdate, and death date of famous people.</li>
                <li>A “Reviews” data set which includes a film ID, user number, critic number, imdb score, number of votes, and number of facebook likes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The queries include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Selecting and counting data.</li>
                <li>Filtering data by various features.</li>
                <li>The use of aggregate functions to summarize data.</li>
                <li>Sorting and grouping data by various features.</li>
            </ul>
