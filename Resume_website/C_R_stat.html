            <p>This project covers simple linear regression and simple logistic regression. 
                In addition to building the models, this project demonstrates how to use the models to make predictions, and how to assess model fit.  
                This project uses three different data sets:


            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The "ad_conversion" data set which contains information on social media advertising is used to assess the fit of a simple linear regression model.</li>
                <li>The "taiwan_real_estate" data set which contains information on the real estate market in Taiwan is used to visualize relationships and make predictions.</li>
                <li>The "churn" data set which contains information from a financial services company is used in a logistic regression model to predict whether a customer will close all accounts (churn) during a time period.</li>
            </ul>
